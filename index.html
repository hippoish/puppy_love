    <ul> <h4>Gilda is looking for a soulmate who...</h4>
      <li>Is well trained and well behaved</li>
      <li>Isn't selfish about sharing his tennis ball in a game of fetch</li>

    </ul>

  <!-- Perfect Date -->
    <h4>Gilda's Perfect Date</h4>

    <p>Gilda loves nothing more than a long walk to the park, followed by hours of playing fetch at the park, followed by a good chunk of time spent chewing her bed/toys/the occassional couch cushion to shreds, followed by an afternoon-long nap on a cool tile floor.</p>

    <p>If you don't mind excessive shedding and a bit of slobbering, and are looking for an eternally good natured partner, Gilda is the one for you!</p>
